<h2>Systems/software developed</h2>
<p>The general idea of my research is to design and implement systems that support decision making in various real-world domains. I investigate and develop different AI-based approaches to building systems, including machine learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning. I am also interested in investigating techniques for improving the efficiency of data mining algorithms.</p>

<h3>Emotion-based music recommender system for tinnitus patients (EMOTIN)</h3>

<img src="images/music/emotion.PNG" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0"" border="1" title="Dimensional model of emotions">
<img src ="images/music/va_model.png" height = "100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0"" border="1" title="Transformation from the current to the desired emotional state">
<p>The system is currently under development. It utilizes a dimensional model of emotion, structured questionnaires for tinnitus patients that detect emotional state, audio processing, and machine learning to recommend songs to tinnitus patients with the goal to relieve their negative emotions associated with tinnitus ("ringing in the ears") into a positive emotional state.</p>

<h3>Sentiment mining-based customer loyalty improvement recommender system (CLIRS2)</h3>
<img src="images/CLIRS2/visual1.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="Recommender system output">
<img src="images/CLIRS2/comments.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="Drilling down recommender options to raw text comments">
<p>This recommender system was proposed and built solely from unstructured data (text comments) on customer feedback on services. It utilizes the concepts of sentiment mining, meta actions and action rules to generate quantifiable recommendations for service improvement with the goal of maximizing the company's revenue and customer base. Publications: <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/web-intelligence/web190423">Sentiment analysis on customer data</a> describes the sentiment mining method and results, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-13438-9_8">Recommender System based on unstructured data</a> presents approach to build RS from unstructured (text) data.</p>

<h3>Customer loyalty improvement recommender system (CLIRS)</h3>
<img src="images/CLIRS/map.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="Semantic similarity between companies">
<img src="images/CLIRS/vis4.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="Data visualizations for attribute analysis">
<p>The system was built at KDD lab of UNC-Charlotte in cooperation with The Daniel Group based in Charlotte. The system helps business consultants to identify areas of business service that lead to improvement of customer satisfaction, as measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS). The approach utilizes data visualization techniques, clustering, action rules, and text mining to generate quantifiable recommendations for business improvement. We have published a <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030134372">book</a> as a complete reference to approach to build the system, together with the detailed description of all the data mining and performance improvement experiments. Shorter guide to the system is described in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-60837-2_4">User Friendly NPS-Based Recommender System for Driving Business Revenue</a> or <a href="CLIRSposter.pdf">poster</a>. Visualization techniques used in the system in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67588-6_14">Visual Analysis of Relevant Features in Customer Loyalty Improvement Recommendation</a>.</p>
<h3>Recommender system for tinnitus diagnosis and treatment (RECTIN)</h3>

<img src="images/RECTIN/gui.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="GUI for visit entry and recomendations output">
<p>The knowledge-based system is built from clinical data on tinnitus patients successfully treated with tinnitus retraining therapy. The idea is to build a knowledge base and patient pattern-matching to support audiologists in the clinical delivery of this niche yet effective method. The system generates precise, personalized, and explainable recommendations for diagnostic and treatment decisions.<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-54966-8_18">Mining for Actionable Knowledge in Tinnitus Datasets</a> describes data mining experiments and results on tinnitus treatment.<a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319514628">This book</a> in Springer's Computational Intelligence series is a complete guide to build a data-driven decision support system for audiology clinicians. <a href="visualAbstractAMIA.pdf">This</a> visual abstract presents prototype GUI-based results.</p>

<h3>Log-analytics based decision support system for security audit (WABSI)</h3>
<img src="images/WABSI/design.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="The high-level architecture of the system">
<img src="images/WABSI/arch.png" height="100" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px" border="0" title="Implementation architecture of the system">
<p>The system utilizes analysis of organizational-wide and cross-system event logs to provide a comprehensive overview of information security compliance. Intelligent processing techniques based on anomaly detection result in alerting of insider threats and malicious activity.
